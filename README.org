** ERC History

This package enhances Emacs's IRC client =ERC= by enabling it to retrieve chat history from channels. Note that chat logs must be archived and accessible online (currently, this package only supports HTTP access).

** Configuration

The primary configuration required is setting the variable =erc-history-sources=, which is a list of sources (HTTP links) and the channels they offer logs for.

The link can include wildcards that will be replaced when pulling chat logs:
- =#CHANNEL#=: The name of the currently viewed channel.
- =TIME=: Replaces all available time formats using Emacs Lisp's =format-time-string= function.

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'erc-history)
  (setq erc-history-sources
    '(("http://localhost/grc-history/#CHANNEL#/%Y/%m/%d.txt"
  ("#erc-history" "#erc-history-1"))))
#+end_src


The configured channels' logs will automatically be retrieved when you navigate to the beginning of their buffers.

Note: Make sure you enable =erc-history-mode=.

*** Elpaca Configuration
In case you use a flexible package manager, you can just link this repo.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package erc-history
  :after erc
  :elpaca (:host github :repo "ebeem/erc-history")
  :hook (erc-mode . erc-history-mode)
  :init
  (setq erc-history-sources
    '(("http://localhost/grc-history/#CHANNEL#/%Y/%m/%d.txt"
  ("#erc-history" "#erc-history-1")))))
#+end_src
