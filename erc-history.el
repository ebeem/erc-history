;;; Commentary:

;; The code contained in this module is responsible for pulling
;; chat logs into ERC buffers.  In order to actually activate this,
;; you must call `erc-history-mode'.

;; You must also customize `erc-history-sources' to list the channel
;; logs available along with their sources/hosts.
